# uofm-halal
A React and Flask App that displays all marked Halal (Zabiha) courses being served at University of Michigan Dining Halls

### Run App
``` python
pip install -r requirements.txt
python run.py
```

### Notes 

* This repository does not include the actual
JSON menu scraper or the JSON files so it will
not do much in its current state

* This currently displays the courses that have
been explicitly marked halal by the university. 
This doesn't mean that the vegetarian courses
served by the halls aren't halal but that there is no 
need to mark them as halal explicitly.

### ToDo

* Build API 
* Build React App
* Design Frontend
